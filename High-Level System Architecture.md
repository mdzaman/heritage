Would you like me to provide detailed implementation steps for any specific phase? I can also create:
1. A detailed development environment setup guide for your MacBook
2. Step-by-step instructions for setting up the AWS infrastructure
3. Database schema design
4. UI wireframes for key features
5. Specific microservice implementation details

Let me know which aspect you'd like to explore first, and I'll provide more detailed guidance.
