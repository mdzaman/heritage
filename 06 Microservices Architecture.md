## Development Guidelines

### For Each Service:
1. Start with API documentation
2. Create database schema
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add unit tests
5. Add integration tests
6. Implement monitoring
7. Add documentation
8. Create deployment config

### Testing Requirements:
1. Unit test coverage > 80%
2. Integration tests for all APIs
3. Performance tests
4. Security tests
5. Load tests

### Documentation Requirements:
1. API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
2. Setup instructions
3. Development guide
4. Deployment guide
5. Monitoring guide


To get started with development:

1. Choose your first service:
   - Authentication is typically a good starting point
   - Followed by User Management
   - Then Family Tree service

2. For each service:
   a. Set up development environment
   b. Create service skeleton
   c. Implement core features
   d. Add tests
   e. Create deployment pipeline

Would you like me to:
1. Detail the implementation steps for a specific service?
2. Create API specifications for any service?
3. Show how to set up the development environment for a particular stack?
4. Provide database schema designs?

Let me know which aspect you'd like to explore further!
